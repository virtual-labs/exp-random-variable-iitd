##### In order to perform the experiment, one need to go through the following steps sequentially:
###### Step 1:  In the simulation step, Select Moments of pdf or Moments of pmf according to the distribution(Continuous or Discrete) .
###### Step 2:  Set all the parameters according to the selected distribution.
###### Step 3:  For PMF, after setting an individual entry, click save. Click show data for the complete distribution table. 
###### Step 4:  For PDF, enter the function.
###### Step 5:  Set the valueof r(rth moment) and k(centre).
###### Step 6:  Click the 'Calculate Moment' button to start the experiment.
###### Step 7:  Hence, r^th moment around k can be viewed.
